## üöÄ SYNOPSIS

The `ft_printf` project is an essential undertaking at 42 school where students are challenged to implement their version of the printf function in the C language.

This project delves into the intricacies of formatting and output in C, requiring students to handle a variety of format specifiers and modifiers.

By successfully completing the ft_printf project, students not only gain a deep understanding of how the printf function works but also enhance their skills in string manipulation and output formatting in C.

This project serves as a valuable exploration of the complexities involved in building a fundamental and widely used standard library function.

## üõ†Ô∏è FUNCTION PROTOTYPES AND CONSIDERATIONS

Name of the function : ft_printf.

Prototype :     <code>int		ft_printf(const char *format, ...) </code>

Placeholders supported :  `` %, c, s, p, d, i, u, x, X``

Flags supported :  ``#+(space)``

Options supported :  `` -0. width``

These flags and options are 100% optional, but they can also be in combination following this pattern:


<code>%[flags][width][.precision]placeholder</code>

Here is a quick reminder of the supported placeholders, flags and options I found online (credits to @mcombeau on Github)

## üóÉÔ∏è GLOBAL STRUCTURE

I started with the ``ft_printf.c`` file, which is the main file where all the logic stars.


Step 1 :
- I initialize va_list (which is a macro from ``stdarg.h``) which allows me to track infinitely every arguments plugged into the ft_printf function.
- I also initlaize a strcuture, which is the key of the function. This structure will contains every aspect of the flags, options and placeholder thanks to the turbo_parsing function, and will help me choose which behaviours to apply to which placeholders.

Step 2 :
- The program will run across the string provided as argument, and either :
1 / print it straight into the standart output (thanks to the ``write`` function from ``unistd.h``, which I encapsulated in a ``ft_putchar`` function).
2 / Stop at the first ``%`` sign, and then process to do the following.

Step 3 :
- The string pointer is passed to the ``turbo_parsing`` function in the ``parsing.c``, which first initialize the structure at zero, and run accross the string following the pattern <code>%[flags][width][.precision]placeholder</code>.
- One the current placeholder parsed with all the flags, it's time to use the parsed structure to print the corresponding plugged argument.

Step 4 :
- ``placeholder_behaviour`` function acts like customs, and redirect with a simple ``if/else`` statement what the placeholder previously parsed. ``va_arg`` allows us to bring the plugged variables and their types, as each placeholder is from a different type.

Step 5 :
- Depending on each placeholder, I decived to check the corresponding possibilities of flags within the function itself, to print or not the corresonding behaviour.


## üßë‚Äçüíª TECHNICAL CHOICES

- I chose not to implement a buffer management just like the real printf function, as the subject asked for it (and it would surpass my skills as well). 
- I assumed that if there were several same flags in the string (such as two ``##``), it would be as if there was only one. So I had to implement a way to still count the flags for the return value without messing up the parsed strcuture.
- I haven't managed the return of error cases in scenarios where flags would be incompatible with certain placeholders (such as the ``#`` flag with the ``%c`` for instance). I just decided to ignore them, despite knowing that the real printf function spits error message and refuses to cooperate and to compile.


## ‚öôÔ∏è USAGE

For simplicity, I made a Makefile that compiles this whole function into a static library.

Step 1 :

Run ``make`` to create a new file, a static library called ``libftprintf.a``

Then run ``make simple_test`` in your terminal to display at screen a simple function call.

(The source code can be found in simple_test.c)

I also created my own custom tester, which consists in calling both ``printf`` and my own ``ft_print``, and passing to them the exacts same arguments and displaying them on the screen.

To do so, run ``make full_test`` in your terminal to display the full tester.

(The source code can be found in full_tester.c)

My ``full_tester.c`` file consists in displaying in a colorful maneer the return values of both ``printf`` and ``ft_printf``, while actually printing the expected results.

NOTE : This tester was also an opportunity to write further code, and also the only way I found to test my function behaviour.

Lastly, I made a last command ``make how_to_use``, which displays a little guide on how to use the function in your own programs !


## üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è SELF-CRITICISM

Despite working as expected, I know for a fact that my code base have 3 major flaws, or improvement ways :

- My codebase is long, very long, and redundant.
- I kind of follow a way of thinking made up of ``if``, ``else``, and ``while`` conditional statements, instead of building more complex but versatile functions.
- My parsing was a bit chaotic (in the ``parsing.c`` file) while working on it because across my codebase, I only plug copies of my original structure instead of a pointer towards it. It does works, but it can be prone to errors.
